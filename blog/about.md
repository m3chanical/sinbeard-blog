# About Me

I am an electrical engineer who is interested in embedded reverse engineering, exploit
development, and anything cyber security related. I know a bit about
many things and in general I'm interested in simply learning.

This page is a major work in progress right now, but I intend to make
pages on this blog of the various projects I get up to. Well, it is pretty much a constant work in progress so eh.
