I'm working on a little self contained solar charged lithium battery for use while camping, off-grid, etc. Will add more later, but for now, here are photos:
I'm also waiting on some acrylic sheets and associated items to arrive so I can build a case for this thing. I thought it'd be fun to mount all of this in a translucent box instead of plywood.
It'll be a lot more work and I'll have to learn a few more things so it should be an interesting task.
