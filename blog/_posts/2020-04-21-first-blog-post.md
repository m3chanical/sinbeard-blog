I've tinkered around with the Hacker github pages theme a bunch and
finally came up with something I like. I've honestly got very little
html/css experience at this point (it's been *many* years), so it was
interesting and fun. 

Anyway, I intend to make each post a separate project, and update it
accordingly. I have several projects that will be worthwhile to post
here.
