# introduction

Recently for an interview I was asked to perform a pentest on a Cudy WR2100 router and report my findings as a presentation. The task was a lot of fun and I had a good time tinkering on it. Now that the interview is over, I am putting my notes and procedure up here to both organize my thoughts and hopefully provide a resource for others. 

# the router

Cudy appears to be a relatively new manufacturer of cheap routers and can be easily obtained from Amazon
