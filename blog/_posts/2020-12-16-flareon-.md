I'm finally getting around to finishing and posting my FlareOn writeups from 2020's challenges. Immediately after I finished I went after learning a few of the things that tripped me up. I became specifically interested in Windows kernel development and some other random malware things that have eaten up a lot of my time. 

Writing these up helps me sort through my thoughts and enumerate what I've learned to further (hopefully) solidify the lessons. Hopefully I can get all these done over the holiday. Lesson learned next year slow down just a bit and take better notes as I progress.
